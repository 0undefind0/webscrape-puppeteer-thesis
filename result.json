      review: 'Sound quality: The overall sound quality is not bad but not good also. The full volume was like 70%-80% of an ordinary wired earphones.\n' +

        'Price: Reasonable (but you might want to reconsider as you can buy cheaper options and it will give you the same/better quality)'

        "I got this for half of it's price on sweldo sale. It's well-packed, sealed and it was delivered fast. I really want to like this tws from Lenovo Thinkplus, I have 4 Thinkplus variants with me and so far this one is the most good looking out of the bunch. Unfortunately, the quality of the sound is disappointing. It lacks treble and bass(almost), voice is clear but I'm more of a bassy person and that's a bit disappointing for me. This is for your everyday use, and you have to tinker around the sound equalizer of your phone to get the right of beat that you're looking for. Also, it's a bit hard to find the right fit on your ear, unlike other tws earbuds, you have to readjust the placing of the earbuds in your ear. Other than that, it could've been a good catch, slick design, compact and amazing price point. The seller ships my order fast and that's a good thing!üòÅüëç"

      review: "The product is nice so far and no major damages when i received the parcel, it's just that the box was a bit broken and the packaging was just fair. I hope you would secure your packages more safely and nicely to avoid damage of the product. Also, I think the right earpod's LED is broken since it does not have light unlike the other whenever i turn it on but anyways it still works so... so far so good. I'll rewrite my review again maybe after weeks (?) of using the product. I hope it will stay as good as it is now :)"
